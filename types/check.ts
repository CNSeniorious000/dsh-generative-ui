/**
 * Asserts the hand-written `$dsh/*` declarations still describe what `bind()` returns.
 *
 * They are hand-written on purpose — a card should see the capability surface, not how it
 * reaches the host — but a surface nobody checks drifts, and the model would find out by
 * getting a false error from `genui check`. This file is type-only: `bun run typecheck` fails
 * if a signature moves without its declaration moving too.
 *
 * The declarations are IMPORTED, not transcribed. An earlier version restated them by hand and
 * said so: "editing a `.d.ts` alone changes nothing — replacing `bash(command: string)` with
 * `bash(command: number)` leaves `tsc` silent." That was true, and it made this file a check on
 * a copy rather than on the thing — the same shape as `compiler.test.ts` testing a
 * re-implementation of its own module. `types/` is on the tsconfig `include`, so the ambient
 * `declare module` blocks resolve here directly.
