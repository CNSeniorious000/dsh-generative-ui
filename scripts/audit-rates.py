"""Print every screen rate quoted in CLAUDE.md that no longer matches the corpus.

`audit-record.py` does this for the N/M prompt scores. This does it for the `N of 378` screen
rates, which are the other kind of number the record quotes as measured fact.

A rate in prose cannot be re-derived, so a widened screen silently invalidates every sentence
citing its old value — `every screen reports 0-3 of 378` was true when written and false the
same day. The policy is to cite `corpus-rates.ts` by name rather than transcribe it; this
catches the sentences that transcribe it anyway.

Usage: scripts/audit-rates.py < a `bun scripts/corpus-rates.ts` run >
