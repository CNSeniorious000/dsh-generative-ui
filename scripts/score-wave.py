"""Score one wave, and — the point of it — say what the model did INSTEAD of a card.

`skill=no fence=0` is where every earlier eval in this project stopped, and it is the least
informative half of the result. Measured on wave 0: six runs across three models all answered a
calorie-log turn with a 7-line markdown table of per-item numbers and a total, and not one loaded
the skill. That is not a model failing to build UI; it is a model building UI in markdown. The
`md` column is what makes that visible, so a wave can distinguish "prose was right" from "a card
was written in the wrong language".
