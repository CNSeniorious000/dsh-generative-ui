/**
 * Compiles the cards in `test/cards/` (or a directory given as argv[2]) and screens them for the three failures that
 * compile cleanly and break at runtime (CLAUDE.md §4): a default export shadowing an import
 * (React #185, a blank card), a JSX subscript `<a[k] />` (illegal where `<a.b />` is fine),
 * and viewport units in something that is a component on someone else's page.
 *
 * The screens were verified against a deliberately broken card before being trusted — the
 * first version's subscript regex matched `useState<number[]>` and missed `<META[k].icon />`,
 * which is exactly backwards.
