"""What the cards a wave produced actually look like — not whether one appeared.

Card RATE answers "did the model decide an interface was warranted". It cannot answer the
questions that follow: is the thing dense, does it fold, did it reach for a library or
hand-roll. Those need the source, which lives in the reply file for a fence card and in
`canvases/` for a canvas one.
