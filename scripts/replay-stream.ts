/**
 * Replays a card as streamed prefixes and reports whether any remount lands on a visible card.
 *
 * The renderer keeps state only while the hook signature holds, so a hook gained mid-stream
 * remounts the tree. Early ones are free; one after the card paints is a visible blank-and-rebuild.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/replay-stream.ts <card.tsx>...
 *
 * A checker that reports zero on every input is indistinguishable from one that is broken —
 * this one reported zero for months because it only ever ran on the six cards it was written
 * against, and reported 35 false positives the first time it saw real ones. So it ends by
 * running `test/cards-negative/`, where every card is *supposed* to fail, and exits non-zero
 * if any of them passes.
