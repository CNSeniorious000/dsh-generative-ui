/**
 * Does the behaviour a rule created actually WORK, or is it just present?
 *
 * A rule that lands has a failure mode a screen cannot see: the attribute appears because the
 * rule asked for it and does nothing. A `:focus-visible` rule whose selector matches no element
 * in the card, an `AbortController` created and never aborted, an `aria-live` region rendered
 * alongside the content it announces rather than around it.
 *
 * These are 50–100× more common in post-rule cards than in the corpus, which makes them
 * effectively new constructs in that population — and new constructs are where cargo-culting
 * shows up.
