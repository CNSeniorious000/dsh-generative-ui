/**
 * Renders each card with `react-dom/server` and reports the ones that paint nothing.
 *
 * `compile-cards.ts` proves a card compiles and passes the screens; neither proves it PAINTS.
 * Two of 17 freshly generated cards called `useState` without importing it — clean under all 18
 * screens, blank on screen. That class of failure is invisible to a text predicate and obvious
 * to a render.
 *
 * The browser driver in `render-check.md` is still the truth (real effects, real layout, real
 * `innerText`). This is the cheap version that needs no browser and runs in `check`.
 *
 * Measured against the 378-card corpus, where the browser found 9 failures: this finds **7 of
 * them and nothing else** — no card that painted in a browser fails here. The two it cannot see
 * both need more than a first synchronous render: a module-scope hook throws React #321 only
 * under a real root, and an unguarded `[0]` needs the effect to have run.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/paint-cards.ts [dir]
