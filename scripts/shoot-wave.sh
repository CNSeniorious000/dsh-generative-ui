# the last wave served the last wave's card under this wave's filename — a screenshot that looks
# fine and belongs to nothing.

# One (card, theme) per line, shot CONCURRENTLY. Every pair is independent — its own harness on
# its own random port, its own output file — and the loop that used to run them one at a time
# spent most of its wall clock waiting for a server to boot: 86 cards x 2 themes x (start +
# poll + shoot + kill) is 172 serial round trips for work with no ordering between any two of
# them. `xargs -P` rather than a hand-rolled gate because macOS ships bash 3.2, which has no
# `wait -n` — a counter-based gate there fails silently open and spawns everything at once.
#
# The cap is deliberately below the core count: each job runs a bun server AND a headless
# Chromium, so the limit is memory and the GPU process, not CPU.
