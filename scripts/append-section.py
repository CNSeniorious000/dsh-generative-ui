"""Append a dated section to CLAUDE.md, in date order.

Written after making the same mistake twice in one session: inserting a section by anchoring on a
neighbouring heading, which puts a 2026-08-24 entry above 2026-08-23 ones and fails
`test/record-structure.test.ts`. The record is oldest-first; a new section goes after the last
section whose date is <= its own.
