# Which conditions have a test that would notice them breaking.
#
# Inverts one `if` at a time and counts failing tests. A condition whose inversion changes nothing
# has no test constraining it — which is how `compiler.test.ts` was found to be testing a
# re-implementation, and how nine live guards (`$dsh/fs` with no host, the traversal fence, the
# panel collapse) were found to be unconstrained.
#
# Three earlier versions of this script under-reported, each silently:
#
# - Mutating a whole file at once. A module that then THROWS on import collapses its tests into
#   one error, so `segments.ts` scored 1 out of 17 while every one of its six conditions was in
#   fact covered. Per-condition is the only reading that means anything.
# - `perl -e 's/if \(([^)]*)\)/'`. A regex stops at the first `)`, so any condition containing a
#   call became a syntax error rather than a mutant — 27 of them here. `invert-ifs.mjs` matches
#   parens instead.
# - `echo "$out"`. zsh's echo expands the `\u` and `\t` in test names, corrupting the lines grep
#   was matching. `printf %s\\n` does not.
#
# Not part of `bun run check`: it rewrites source files and takes about an hour. Run it deliberately.

# `set -e` plus a rewritten source file is a bad combination: a failure between the mutation and
