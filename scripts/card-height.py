"""How tall the cards a wave produced actually render.

The density rule ("the unopened card should sit inside roughly two thirds of the viewport") had
no measurement behind it. This is it, and unlike the card RATE it is deterministic: the same card
renders to the same height every time, so a change of a few points is a change, not noise.

Heights come from the screenshots, which are taken at deviceScaleFactor 3 — divide by that to get
CSS pixels, which is what a viewport fraction is about.
