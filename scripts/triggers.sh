# Does a prompt that SHOULD produce a card produce one?
#
# The nine trigger rules are the only ones with nothing behind them — a screen asks whether a card
# is wrong, and these ask whether there should have been a card at all. The only way to answer is
# to run the prompt and count fences.
#
# Not part of `bun run check`: each case is a real model turn, minutes each.
#
# ONE RUN PER CASE DOES NOT MEASURE A RULE. `98 华氏度是多少摄氏度` — quoted verbatim in its own
# rule — came back as prose once and as a card on the next four runs. The trigger decision is a
# model judgement, so it has a RATE, not a verdict, and a single miss is evidence of nothing.
# Pass a repeat count to get one:
#
#     zsh scripts/triggers.sh            # every case once — a smoke test, not a measurement
#     zsh scripts/triggers.sh 换算       # only cases whose rule or prompt matches
#     zsh scripts/triggers.sh "" 5       # every case five times, reporting each rate
