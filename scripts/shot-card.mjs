// Screenshot one card on the real GenUISurface, for the half of "is this card any good" that
// only the eye can answer: a card can paint every node, announce every state, and still be
// unreadable. `mount-card.sh` reports text and a11y state; this reports layout.
//
// Shoots every breakpoint the card will actually meet. A card is rendered in a chat column and
// in a panel the reader drags, so `@container` queries mean the layout at 320 is a different
// design from the layout at 720 — judging one of them judges a third of the card.
//
// Needs playwright, which this repo does not depend on. It resolves one from a sibling checkout
// rather than requiring the caller to `cd` there first — three separate runs today failed with
// MODULE_NOT_FOUND because the shot was fired from whatever directory the previous step left.
// ego-browser's Page.captureScreenshot times out against this page, so playwright it is.
//
// Usage: node scripts/shot-card.mjs <port> <out-prefix> [widths]
//   with `bun scripts/surface-harness.ts <port> <card.tsx>` already running (THEME=dark for the
