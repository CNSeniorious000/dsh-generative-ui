/*
 * Drive it with ego-browser: open `/`, then in the page compile each `/card/:name` through
 * @esm.sh/tsx, import it as a blob module, mount it with createRoot, and read back innerText.
 *
 * When clicking a control from script, dispatch the whole sequence
 * (pointerdown, mousedown, pointerup, mouseup, click) — a bare `.click()` on a React button
 * can leave state untouched and looks exactly like a broken card.
 *
 * Two more rules, each of which produced a wrong number before it was found:
 *
 * - **Click ONE control, not every control.** A segmented group (`linear`/`log`, a filter row,
 *   a tab strip) is set and immediately unset by a loop that clicks all of its buttons, so the
 *   card ends exactly where it started and reads as inert. Four of six re-tested cards flipped
 *   from "inert" to "responded" on this change alone.
 * - **Diff `innerHTML`, not `innerText`.** A highlighted tab, a changed border, a chart axis —
 *   every visual-only state change is invisible to a text diff. Even HTML misses a recharts
 *   re-render that happens to produce identical SVG, so "no change" is weak evidence at best.
 *
 * The loop that worked, with the two things that each cost a wasted run:
 *
 * ```js
 * const tsx = await import("https://esm.sh/@esm.sh/tsx@1.0.5"); await tsx.default()
 * // `.code` is a STRING here, not bytes — decoding it throws and every card reports THREW.
 * const out = tsx.transform({ filename: "_.tsx", code, target: "es2022", jsxImportSource: "react" }).code
 * const mod = await import(URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([out], { type: "text/javascript" })))
 * // Capture console.error around the render. React renders an EMPTY TREE on a throw and says
 * // nothing visible — all four blank cards in the corpus were only explicable this way.
 * const errs = []; const real = console.error; console.error = (...a) => errs.push(String(a[0]))
 * createRoot(mount).render(React.createElement(mod.default))
 * await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 90)); console.error = real
 * ```
 *
 * Waiting longer does not turn a blank card into a painted one: measured at 90ms, 400ms and
 * 1200ms, `innerHTML.length` stayed 0. A blank card is broken, not slow.
