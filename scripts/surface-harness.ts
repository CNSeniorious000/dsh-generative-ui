/**
 * Serves the real `GenUISurface` against a local React, so a card can be mounted the way the
 * plugin mounts it — including partial-react's error boundary, which is what decides whether a
 * throwing card shows a message or nothing at all.
 *
 * Local, not esm.sh: the verification browser cannot always reach it, and a card under test
 * should not fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the card. The tsx wasm comes from
 * `node_modules` on the plugin's own asset route, exactly as `compiler.ts` fetches it.
 *
 * Usage: `bun scripts/surface-harness.ts [port] [card.tsx]`. With a card path it also serves the
 * source at `/card` and the icon names it imports at `/icons`; the driver registers a stand-in for
 * lucide with `registerModules`, which `/surface.js` re-exports for exactly that purpose:
 *
 *   const { GenUISurface, registerModules } = await import("/surface.js")
 *   const icon = () => React.createElement("span")
 *   registerModules({ "lucide-react": Object.fromEntries((await (await fetch("/icons")).json()).map(n => [n, icon])) })
 *
 * Then in ego-browser import `/surface.js` and
 * render `GenUISurface` with `{ code, streaming, onError }`. React comes from the UMD globals
 * (`globalThis.React` / `globalThis.ReactDOM`), not from a bare import.
 *
 * Cards importing `$dsh/*` mount here. They did not until `$dsh/internal` stopped being
 * registered inside `registerUi4aHost` — a page with no host got capability blobs importing an
 * empty module, and the card rendered silently blank. `$dsh/state` works fully (no host behind
 * it); the host-backed ones lay out correctly and only throw `no host bound` at the moment they
 * are actually called, which is what a preview should do.
