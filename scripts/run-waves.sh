# Drive a range of waves back to back, one process, resumable.
#
# A single wave is ~72 runs and outlives most shell-level timeouts, so each wave used to be started
# by hand and lost partway. This loop owns the whole range: `run-wave.py` caches completed runs, so
# re-invoking this after any interruption picks up exactly where it stopped.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/run-waves.sh <from> <to>   (WAVE_ROOT defaults to ~/.cache/genui-loop)
