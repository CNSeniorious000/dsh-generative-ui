/**
 * Two things the host forces on this config, both non-negotiable:
 *
 * `important` receives a SELECTOR STRING, which is how UnoCSS scopes: every rule comes out
 * `.ui4a-root :is(.gap-4){…}`. The runtime sheet is appended to `<head>` last, so an unscoped
 * `hidden` written by a card would win over the shell's own `hidden` and make part of the app
 * vanish. The playground has that bug on record (a sidebar disappearing); we start scoped.
 *
 * `preflights: { reset: false }` drops presetWind4's global reset — 3.5KB of `*, ::before,
 * ::after { margin: 0; border: 0 solid }` that would land on the HOST's DOM, not just ours.
 * The `theme` layer survives it and is the part we need: `--spacing` and `--radius-*`, which
 * every `gap-*` and `rounded-*` resolves against. Without preflights entirely those rules
 * generate but compute to nothing.

  // The reset above is dropped because it targets `*` and would land on the HOST's DOM. But
  // dropping it leaves form controls carrying the browser's own chrome, and that is not
  // theme-aware: measured on a card in dark mode, two unselected `<button>`s rendered as light
  // grey blocks with black text, because a button with no background class falls back to the UA's
  // `buttonface`. The card looked right in light and broken in dark, which is the failure this
  // whole colour system exists to prevent.
  //
  // So: the same normalisation, scoped to our root.
  //
  // `box-sizing: border-box` is in here for the same reason, and I left it out at first on the
  // theory that cards set their own sizing. They cannot: `w-full` is `width: 100%`, and under the
  // UA's `content-box` that 100% is the content alone, so every `<input className="w-full px-3
  // border">` is padding-plus-border wider than its parent. Measured on wave 2 — every card with a
  // text field overflowed its own edge by 10px at 320, 440 AND 720, which is the tell that it was
  // never a breakpoint problem. The clip in a screenshot is taken at the card width, so the
  // overflowing strip is not cut off, it is absent.
