 *   `setImportMap` only stores, so that buffer stays compiled against a map without these
 *   entries — and an unresolvable bare specifier kills the whole module graph, so the card is

 *   report. A cold probe is 1.0s and the import behind it another 2.4s, so the window this
 *   covers is seconds wide, not a frame.
 * - **store** — a newer frame has already been delivered, and it will apply the map itself.
 *   Re-delivering here instead would replace the buffer with the prefix that was current when
 *   the probe fired, truncating the stream mid-flight.
 *
 * `redeliver` renders `deliveredRef.current`, which is read at SETTLE time — the newest buffer,
