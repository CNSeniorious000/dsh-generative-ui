/**
 * Sends a card's compile error back to the model as a chat message.
 *
 * Until this existed, `onError` had no consumer at all: a card that failed to compile painted a
 * red panel for the reader and the model never learned anything. Measured on a real session —
 * a card imported `MonacoEditor` from `modern-monaco`, the surface reported *"has no export named
 * 'MonacoEditor'; module exports: Workspace, errors, hydrate, init, lazy"*, and the transcript
 * ends there: `MonacoEditor` appears 6 times in the records after that point and `no export named`
 * zero. The reader saw the answer on screen; the one party who could act on it did not.
 *
 * Four constraints, each of which this got wrong in an obvious first version:
 *
 * - **Only errors that survived.** `GenUISurface` already separates a mid-stream prefix failure
 *   and a retryable network blip from a real one — the `report` branch of its error action. That
 *   branch is the only caller, so a half-written expression never reaches the model.
 *
 *   It is not sufficient on its own, though. `isUnfinishedFrame` excludes the RENDER phase by
 *   design — a card whose own render throws is usually a real error — but a half-written
 *   component rendering mid-stream throws too, and the next frame is fine. Measured in a browser:
 *   a card that ultimately rendered correctly reported `Cannot read properties of undefined
 *   (reading 'getCurrentStack')`, a React internal, to the model. Painting a red panel for a
 *   frame costs nothing; sending the model a message about a card that then worked costs it a
 *   turn spent fixing what is not broken. So the send is DEFERRED, and a paint cancels it.
 * - **Once per card, not once per frame.** A settled card that fails re-renders on every later
 *   frame of the transcript, and a turn per render is a loop the user has to kill. Deduplication
 *   lives HOST-side now (`CardFailures.set`), because this half is thrown away by every
 *   navigation and a dedup set that resets on reload wakes the model about a card it already
 *   knows. What stays here is the settling, which is about frames, not about turns.
 * - **Recovery is reported too.** The report is state, not an event: a card that starts working
 *   sends `null`, and the host drops it out of the model's context. As a chat message that was
 *   impossible, which is why the old body had to carry a paragraph explaining that nobody had
 *   typed it.
 * - **Only the newest card counts.** An earlier card that cannot render stays in the transcript
 *   and re-renders on every later frame, so it goes on failing for the rest of the session.
 *   Measured on a real one: the model wrote a card importing `Github` from `lucide-react`
 *   (removed upstream), was told, fixed it to `GitBranch` in its very next reply — and the
 *   failure notice kept coming back from the message it had already superseded. There is nothing
 *   the model can do with that; it cannot edit a reply it has sent. `isNewestCard` is the gate.
