/**
 * The repair's boundary, measured — and it decides which rules matter.

 * `normalizeGeneratedTsx` will supply a **hook**: it inserts the whole `import … from "react"`
 * line when there is none, and extends an existing one with any hook it finds used. It will not
 * supply a JSX **component**. So:
 *
 *   - no import at all + `useState`            → repaired, renders
 *   - `import { useState }` + `useMemo(...)`   → repaired, renders
 *   - `import { useState }` + `<Fragment>`     → NOT repaired, `Fragment is not defined`, blank
 *
 * Only the third reaches a reader broken, which is why `MISSING-REACT-IMPORT` deliberately stays
 * quiet on the first two — and why *Import every name you write, `Fragment` included* is aimed
 * exactly where the repair cannot reach. Getting this wrong twice in one afternoon produced both
 * an overstated finding and a control card that did not break.
