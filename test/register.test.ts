/**
 * The document import map.
 *
 * Generated code is imported as a blob module, and packages fetched from esm.sh arrive as
 * already-compiled JS whose `import … from "react"` survives verbatim — the browser resolves
 * those bare specifiers against the **document** import map alone. Without one, any card that
 * uses a third-party package dies on `Failed to resolve module specifier "react"`.
 *
 * It can be installed once and only before the first module resolution, so all three rules here
 * are one-shot and unrecoverable if wrong.
