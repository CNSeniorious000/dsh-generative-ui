/**
 * A checker that compiles cards differently from `compiler.ts` reports failures a reader would
 * never see, and misses ones they would. Both happened: `compile-cards.ts` had no `streaming`
 * fallback and reported a working 243-line card as FAIL; `paint-cards.ts` skipped normalization
 * altogether and so tested a path production never takes.
 *
 * `compileSettled` in `tsx-node.ts` is the shared two-step. This test exists so a third script
 * calling `compileCard` on a whole card — rather than on a deliberately-crafted snippet — has to
 * justify itself here first.
