/**
 * The shared transcript observer.
 *
 * The coalescing is the load-bearing part: a streaming reply mutates the transcript dozens of
 * times per second and one sweep per mutation is how a renderer melts the main thread. That is
 * an invariant about *counts*, which is exactly what a test can hold and a comment cannot.
 *
 * No DOM here, so `MutationObserver`, `document` and the frame callbacks are stubbed. That is
 * enough because the module's own logic — coalesce, start once, tear down at zero — never
 * touches anything else about them.
