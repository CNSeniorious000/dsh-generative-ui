/**
 * The node half's registration, which nothing has ever run.
 *
 * `smoke.ts` loads the built CLIENT bundle and runs its `apply()`; the server half's is only
 * exercised in a real profile. Its structure is the whole of the plugin's degradation story —
 * every capability is a NESTED inject, deliberately, so a profile without `shell` loses
 * `$dsh/exec` and keeps everything else. A static `inject` naming all of them would take the
 * prompt and the skill down with it, which is the entire plugin.
 *
 * The context is a fake that records what was asked for and runs every callback, so this is
 * about which routes appear under which dependency, not about serving a request.
