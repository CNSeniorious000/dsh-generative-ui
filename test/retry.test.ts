/**
 * That a retry actually reaches the network.
 *
 * The module registry caches a failed `import()` as a rejection for the page's lifetime, so
 * re-importing the same URL never re-fetches — measured in Chromium, 2 resource entries for 3
 * imports. `GenUISurface`'s retry therefore has to change the URL, and this holds the rule that
 * makes that work.
 *
 * A real browser is not needed for the part that can regress: the busting is a pure string
 * transform, and the property that matters is that consecutive attempts produce **different**
 * URLs for esm.sh entries and **identical** ones for local blobs.
 *
 * Imported, not re-declared. A test that copies the transform it guards only proves two copies
 * agree — which is how `compiler.test.ts` stayed green through six real mutations.
