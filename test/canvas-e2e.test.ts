/**
 * A real multi-file canvas, resolved the way the panel and the server actually do it.
 *
 * Nothing exercised this before, which is how a `lastIndex` bug that dropped EVERY sibling
 * import shipped: the unit tests each passed one hand-written specifier, and the shape that
 * broke needed two calls on the same string in production's order.
 *
 * The fixture is unretouched output — six files, one entry importing five sub-pages by
 * `./<id>/<name>`, and four of those importing `./ui` and `./data` as siblings of each other.
 * That second form is the one a bare filename in `from` silently rejects.
