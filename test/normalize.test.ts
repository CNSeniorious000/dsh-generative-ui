/**
 * `partial-tsx`'s two normalization modes, asserted directly against the compiler.
 *
 * **This file deliberately does not import `compiler.ts`** — it pins the DEPENDENCY's behaviour,
 * which is what `compiler.ts` is built on top of. It was once named `compiler.test.ts` and read
 * as coverage of that module; it was not. Rewriting every `return` in `compiler.ts` to
 * `undefined` (six real mutations) left this file entirely green, because it re-assembles the
 * pipeline from `transform` and `normalizeGeneratedTsx` rather than calling it.
 *
 * `compile-pipeline.test.ts` is the one that exercises the module. Keep the two apart: if an
 * assertion here starts needing `createBrowserTsxCompiler`, it belongs in that file.
