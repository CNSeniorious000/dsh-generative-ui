/**
 * Test-file hygiene, as a test.
 *
 * Bun shares one global object and one module registry across the whole run, so a file that
 * stubs `document` or leaves a transcript listener registered breaks a DIFFERENT file — which
 * is why this suite failed half of all shuffled orders while every file passed alone. The rules
 * below are what fixed it; a new file that stubs a global would silently reintroduce the flake.
 *
 * Checked by reading the sources rather than by running anything: the failure mode is a file
 * that never runs the cleanup, and nothing observes that from inside a passing test.
