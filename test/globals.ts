/**
 * The real globals, captured before any test file installs a stub.
 *
 * Bun keeps one global object per test RUN, not per file, and every file's module body runs
 * before any test does. So a file capturing `globalThis.document` at module load may already be
 * holding another file's stub — restoring that later *installs* the stub rather than removing
 * it, which is worse than not restoring at all.
 *
 * Importing this module from every stubbing file makes the capture happen exactly once, in
 * whichever file bun loads first, and `restoreGlobals()` then always puts back the real thing.
