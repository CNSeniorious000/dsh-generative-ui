/**
 * The sweep's per-frame cost.
 *
 * `collectCanvases` walks every argument string by hand — that is what makes it correct on a
 * half-arrived JSON prefix, and it costs ~0.16ms per canvas. The sweep runs on **every
 * transcript mutation**, so before the calls key was added, the corpus's busiest session (34
 * canvas writes) spent 3.7ms per streamed token re-deriving a result that had not changed.
 *
 * A timing assertion is a blunt instrument, so this one is deliberately loose: it asserts the
 * cheap path is an order of magnitude cheaper than the walk, which is a property of the
 * algorithm rather than of the machine. Measured 3.725ms against 0.014ms — 265×.

/*
 * The BEST of several batches, not the mean of one — and few enough iterations that the whole
 * test stays well inside the default 5s timeout.
 *
 * A mean measures the machine as much as the code: on a loaded box the scheduler can preempt
 * either batch, and whichever it preempts decides the ratio. The minimum is the run that was not
 * interrupted, which is the one that says something about the algorithm — the property under test
 * is a 265x gap, so a sample anywhere near the truth passes easily.
 *
 * The iteration count is part of the fix, not an accident. The first version of this repair took
 * the best of five batches of forty and made the test FIVE TIMES SLOWER, so it started failing on
 * the 5s timeout instead of on the assertion — a "fix" whose failures looked identical to the bug
 * it replaced. The walk is ~0.16ms per canvas over 34 canvases, so 3 x 8 is ~130ms of real work.
