/**
 * `CLAUDE.md` is the design doc, and it once grew to 8,983 lines because every measurement was
 * appended as its own dated section — 295 of them, 99% of the file, with the design doc itself
 * buried in the first 10%. The raw record moved to `docs/measurements-log.md` and §6 keeps each
 * lesson once.
 *
 * So the check is now a ceiling rather than a floor: dated sections are for the handful of
 * historical notes inside the design text, and a file drifting back toward a log will trip this
 * long before anyone notices by reading. Order and uniqueness still matter for the ones that
 * remain — an edit anchored on a phrase that is not unique drops a section into the middle of
 * another and splits an argument in half, which is exactly what reading is worst at catching.
