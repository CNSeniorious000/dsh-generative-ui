/**
 * A screen must not accuse a card of something it has not written yet.
 *
 * The screens run on settled cards today, but the obvious next use is warning while the model
 * is still typing — and a screen that fires on a prefix and clears when the card finishes would
 * report a card that is fine. Measured over every 10% prefix of all 378 corpus cards: exactly
 * one screen does that, and it is inherent rather than a defect (see below).
 *
 * Kept as a property rather than a plan: it costs one test and it is the kind of thing that
 * quietly stops being true when a screen is widened.

/**
 * Two exceptions, and neither can be otherwise: in both, the **guard follows the defect in the
 * text**, so a prefix cut between them shows the defect alone.
 *
 * - `NO-FOCUS-RING` fires on `outline: "none"` and clears when the replacement appears.
 * - `UNGUARDED-NUMBER-INPUT` fires on `Number(e.target.value)` and clears on the `|| 0` after
 *   it — measured against the corpus, `01bf50a29bde` is cut mid-guard at 70%.
 * - `UNSTOPPABLE-MOTION` fires on `@keyframes` and clears on the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`
 *   block, which by convention comes last in a `<style>`.
 *
 * - `TRANSITION-WITHOUT-TRANSFORM` fires on `transition: "transform …"` and clears when the
 *   `transform` property itself appears — which in a style object is the very next line.
 *
 * - `UNANNOUNCED-ASYNC-RESULT` fires on the fetch and clears on the `aria-live` container the
 *   results land in — which is in the JSX, written after every hook and handler.
 *
 * - `SWALLOWED-CAPABILITY-FAILURE` fires on the `try`/`catch` and clears on the `setError` inside
 *   it — written a line or two later, and the JSX that renders it later still.
 *
 * All six are the same shape, which is worth stating: the fix is written AFTER the thing it
 * fixes, so any cut between them shows the defect alone. That is a property of how CSS and
 * JavaScript are written, not a flaw in these predicates. The fourth, fifth and sixth were all
 * predicted here before they existed — a seventh is expected rather than investigated.
 *
 * The rest have no such ordering. This is the property that would let the screens run WHILE the
 * model types, so knowing which two cannot is the useful part.
